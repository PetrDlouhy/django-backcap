And that's what your users are going to do with you ! ;-)

What is backcap ?

Backcap is a community-driven support module for any website.  

With it, users can post ideas, problems and questions to your support
team. People can vote for or against a feedback and you naturally see
what's important for your community.

developped it, to provides a nice help center for the SpreadBand
