Backcap
=======

Backcap (Am.), to do one an ill-turn by speaking evil of 
him or carrying tales, or otherwise to "spoil his game." 

And that's what your users are going to do with you ! ;-)

What is backcap ?
=================

Backcap is a community-driven support module for any website.  

With it, users can post ideas, problems and questions to your support
team. People can vote for or against a feedback and you naturally see
what's important for your community.

In fact, that's something like an Help Center. And this is why we have
developped it, to provides a nice help center for the SpreadBand
website.
